# RandomPass

Very Small and Simple PHP script to create random password based in letters, numbers and symbols.

Copy the index.php file to de root directory in your web server, it will show you 4 colums with string with 10, 15, 20 and 30 characters, each column contain 10 string examples.

If you need more characters in the string, you can use the "?i=50" so get a new column with 10 string examples with 50 chactares, you can personalize the number of characters from 1 to infinitive ;-).

Very slow response or no response if you use "?i=100000000" or more, ;-) !!!!
